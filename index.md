I am an economist at [Insee](https://insee.fr/fr/accueil), the French national statistical office, and an affiliated researcher at [Crest](https://crest.science/) and [Ined](https://demographie-economique.site.ined.fr/). My research lies at the intersection of Labor, Health, and Public Economics, with a particular focus on Gender and Family Economics.

I study how family life shapes labor market outcomes and organizational dynamics. My recent work examines, for instance, the cultural roots of the child penalty, or how nurses’ parenthood affects hospital organization.

Before joining Insee, I worked at [Drees](https://drees.solidarites-sante.gouv.fr/etudes-et-statistiques/), the statistical and research division of the French Ministry of Health and Social Affairs.
