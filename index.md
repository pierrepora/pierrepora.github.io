I am an economist at [Insee](https://insee.fr/fr/accueil), the French national statistical office, where I lead a team focused on family dynamics and demography. Previously, I worked at [Drees](https://drees.solidarites-sante.gouv.fr/etudes-et-statistiques/), the statistical and research division of the French Ministry of Health and Social Policy. 

I am also an affiliate researcher at [Crest](https://crest.science/) and [Ined](https://demographie-economique.site.ined.fr/).

My research focuses on Labor Economics, Health Economics, and Policy Evaluation, with a particular emphasis on Gender and Family Economics. I study how family dynamics, especially motherhood, impact labor market outcomes. I also explore the effects of policies like telework and childcare on labor force participation and productivity. My work addresses issues of wage inequality, job insecurity, and career mobility. The goal is to inform policies that support equity and workers' well-being.
