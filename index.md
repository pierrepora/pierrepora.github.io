I am currently employed as an economist at [Insee](https://insee.fr/fr/accueil), the French national statistical bureau, where I manage a team devoted to family dynamics and demography. I was previously employed at [Drees](https://drees.solidarites-sante.gouv.fr/etudes-et-statistiques/), the statistical and research unit of the French ministry of Health and Social Policy. I am also a [Crest](https://crest.science/) research affiliate.

I recently defended my Ph.D. dissertation at [Université Paris Nanterre (EconomiX)](https://economix.fr/), which is devoted to the impact of family relations on labor supply.

My research interests lie within Labor Economics, Health Economics and Empirical Policy Evaluation, with a special focus on Gender and Family Economics.
