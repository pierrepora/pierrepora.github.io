I am currently employed as an economist at [Insee](https://insee.fr/fr/accueil), the French national statistical bureau, where I manage a team devoted to family dynamics and demography. I was previously employed at [Drees](https://drees.solidarites-sante.gouv.fr/etudes-et-statistiques/), the statistical and research unit of the French ministry of Health and Social Policy. I am also a [Crest](https://crest.science/) research affiliate.

My research interests lie within Labor Economics, Health Economics and Empirical Policy Evaluation, with a special focus on Gender and Family Economics. Specifically, my research mostly deals with family-work conciliation and gender inequality in the labor market.
