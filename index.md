I am an economist at [Insee](https://insee.fr/fr/accueil), the French national statistical office, and an affiliated researcher at [Crest](https://crest.science/) and [Ined](https://demographie-economique.site.ined.fr/). My research lies at the intersection of Labor, Health, and Public Economics, with a particular focus on Gender and Family Economics.

I study how family life shapes labor market outcomes and organizational dynamics. My recent work examines for instance the cultural roots of the child penalty, or how nurses’ parenthood affects hospital organization.

Before joining Insee, I worked at [Drees](https://drees.solidarites-sante.gouv.fr/etudes-et-statistiques/), the statistical and research division of the French Ministry of Health and Social Affairs.

["Traditional Views, Egalitarian Views, and the Child Penalty: Insights from Immigrant Populations in France"](ChildPenalty_JMP.pdf), with D. Meurs

  This study examines whether the child penalty is driven by traditional gender attitudes using French survey data on immigrants. While women with traditional views participate less in the labor force, their child penalty is not larger. Consequently, the child penalty explains a greater share of gender gaps among immigrants with egalitarian views. Comparative analyses across upbringing environments and countries of origin confirm the absence of a causal link between gender attitudes and the child penalty. The findings suggest that as norms become more egalitarian, the child penalty accounts for a growing share of gender disparities in labor outcomes.
